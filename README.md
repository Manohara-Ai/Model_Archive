# Model Archive

Welcome to my Model Archive! This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning models.
## Types of Models

- **Convolutional Neural Network Models**
  - Description: Models that utilize convolutional layers to process and classify visual data.

- **Decision Trees**
  - Description: Models that use a tree-like structure for making decisions based on input features.

- **Deep Learning Models**
  - Description: Various deep learning architectures for tasks such as classification, regression, and more.

- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**
  - Description: Models that generate new data instances by learning from existing datasets.

- **Neural Network Models**
  - Description: A collection of traditional neural network architectures.

- **Draconix (Helper Function)**
  - Description: A module containing helper functions to assist with model training and evaluation.


## Note

This repository serves as an archive of my models. For specific details about each model, please refer to the README files located in each model's directory, if available.
